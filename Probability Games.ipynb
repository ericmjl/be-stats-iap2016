    "Here are some probability games that you can try out during the latter 1.5 hours of class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of these games are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Refresh your memory of probability rules.\n",
    "2. Get your mind thinking about probability problems, which may come handy in later classes.\n",
    "3. Give you a warm-up to Bayesian thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems are directly taken from the [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/thinkbayes) and [Allen Downey's]() website, so while theoretically you can always go and look at the answer, you'll benefit most from working it out with others on the blackboard, or if you're feeling up for a challenge, by coding the solution up."
